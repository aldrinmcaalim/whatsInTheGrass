# What's in the Grass?

Click on the "Grassy Field" image and it will give you a random animal (out of 6 animals) with a small paragraph caption at the bottom of the "Go back" button. And once you're on the random animal, you are, thanks to the JavaScript and CSS I added, prevented from clicking on the image again for another random animal. You are given the opportunity to click on the "Go Back" button which resets the entire behavior of the webpage.
